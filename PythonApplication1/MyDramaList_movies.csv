Ju-on: The Curse,/625-ju-on-the-curse,2000,"Mystery, Horror, Supernatural","""Ju-On: The Curse"" is comprised of six vignettes. Each one centers around a different character, but the timeline between episodes is not always chronological. There is always some kind of connection between them, however, and this makes the film work on a deeper level. It's not quite as common-sense as ""Momento,"" but that only adds to the replay value.   The first episode, ""Toshio,"" will be recognizable to those who have seen ""The Grudge."" It tells the story of a teacher who visits the home of a little boy who has been absent from school. While there, he discovers that the house may be haunted. While the American remake has very little interaction between this teacher and other characters, ""The Curse,""in one of the most difficult scenes to watch, displays a disturbing connection between him and another, surprising, person.   Other vignettes revolve around the house and those who live or visit there. Some are similar to scenes in the remake while others, such as a scene revolving around a character who is terrified of cats, will seem unusual to some Westerners unfamiliar with Japanese superstitions (And speaking of our feline-fearing friend, if you thought the first couple of minutes in the attic during ""The Grudge"" were scary, wait until you see this expanded version of the intro scene. It's worse. Much worse.).   The main difference between this film and ""The Grudge"" is one of quality: ""Ju-On: The Curse"" was shot directly on video. It is filmed as if it were a theatrical release (meaning there's no jumpy ""Blair Witch"" action here), but the stark quality of the images makes it more visceral and accessible than any other of the other films in the series. The sharp camera work adds a voyeuristic quality that only adds to the creepiness of the film. -- asianmediawiki ","Yanagi Yurei, Fuji Takako",Japanese

Jiseul,/5667-jiseul,2013,Drama,"A local film worthy of notice, the monochrome JISEUL is the fourth film by Jeju director O Muel. It is based on the true story of the townsfolk that took sanctuary in a cave during an uprising on the island in April 1948. The Jeju 4.3 Uprising, as it later became known, was sparked when the American military regime incited social strife and subsequent conflicts that lasted until September 1954. Almost 30,000 people are estimated to have been killed–most of them civilians. The reason why the modest film feels like a solemn requiem may be rooted in resentment. Although the ire over the slaughtered innocents might be sitting at the fore of director O’s mind, the film itself never explicitly expresses it. It reveals bits of lives–quarrels, conflicts, reconciliation and comfort, sometimes nonchalantly and sometimes dramatically. Ironically, because of this, the pain stings that much more. Narrative structure choices, scale as an independent film and sound effects all go toward enhancing the impression of a requiem. ","O Muel  (dir.), Lee Kyung Joon, Moon  Suk Bum",Korean
